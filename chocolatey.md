**Hi - this is just a complicated way of sending you an e-mail, so just ignore the PR-part**

I have created a chocolatey community package for the Banksia GUI, so I (and anyone) can do

```powershell
choco install banksiagui -y
```
to conveniently download your Banksia GUI (requires the chocolatey client, https://chocolatey.org/install). Only meta-properties, like links to your repo and web-site, links to the download etc. is included in the chocolatey package, so no artifacts from your repo is contained in the chocolatey package. 

I just wanted to inform you, and ask: 

 - would you like to manage this package yourself?

I don't mind to do it, but since Banksia GUI is your work, I would at least offer to transfer the chocolatey package to you, if you want control of it yourself. 

Note chat chocolatey is a Windows package manager (if your'e not a Windows user), a concept that for a long time was ignored on Windows (at least by Microsoft). The code used in the chocolatey package for your Banksia GUI is here: https://github.com/henrikhalt/chocos/tree/master/banksiagui

Please feel free to contact me on henrik.halt@gmail.com if you wish, or ship a comment in this file. 

Thanks for your work on this awesome piece of software. 

Regards, Henrik.
